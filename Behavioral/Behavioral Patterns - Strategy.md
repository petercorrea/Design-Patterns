# Behavioral Patterns - Strategy

###### Design patterns enable us to refactor code to provide clarity and intent through structure. They allow us to apply general solutions to common problems. Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

#### Objects

- The **Context** maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies and communicates with this object only via the strategy interface.

- The **Strategy** interface is common to all concrete strategies. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.

- **Concrete Strategies** implement different variations of an algorithm the context uses.

- The context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesnâ€™t know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.

- The **Client** creates a specific strategy object and passes it to the context. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.

#### Application

- Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
- Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
- Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.

#### Code

```typescript

// The strategy interface declares operations common to all
// supported versions of some algorithm. The context uses this
// interface to call the algorithm defined by the concrete
// strategies.
interface Strategy is
    method execute(a, b)

// Concrete strategies implement the algorithm while following
// the base strategy interface. The interface makes them
// interchangeable in the context.
class ConcreteStrategyAdd implements Strategy is
    method execute(a, b) is
        return a + b

class ConcreteStrategySubtract implements Strategy is
    method execute(a, b) is
        return a - b

class ConcreteStrategyMultiply implements Strategy is
    method execute(a, b) is
        return a * b

// The context defines the interface of interest to clients.
class Context is
    // The context maintains a reference to one of the strategy
    // objects. The context doesn't know the concrete class of a
    // strategy. It should work with all strategies via the
    // strategy interface.
    private strategy: Strategy

    // Usually the context accepts a strategy through the
    // constructor, and also provides a setter so that the
    // strategy can be switched at runtime.
    method setStrategy(Strategy strategy) is
        this.strategy = strategy

    // The context delegates some work to the strategy object
    // instead of implementing multiple versions of the
    // algorithm on its own.
    method executeStrategy(int a, int b) is
        return strategy.execute(a, b)

// The client code picks a concrete strategy and passes it to
// the context. The client should be aware of the differences
// between strategies in order to make the right choice.
class ExampleApplication is
    method main() is
        Create context object.

        Read first number.
        Read last number.
        Read the desired action from user input.

        if (action == addition) then
            context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyAdd())

        if (action == subtraction) then
            context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategySubtract())

        if (action == multiplication) then
            context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyMultiply())

        result = context.executeStrategy(First number, Second number)

        Print result.
```
