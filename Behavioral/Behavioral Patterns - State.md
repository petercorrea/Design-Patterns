# Behavioral Patterns - State

###### Design patterns enable us to refactor code to provide clarity and intent through structure. They allow us to apply general solutions to common problems. Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

#### Objects

- **Context** stores a reference to one of the concrete state objects and delegates to it all state-specific work. The context communicates with the state object via the state interface. The context exposes a setter for passing it a new state object.

- The **State** interface declares the state-specific methods. These methods should make sense for all concrete states because you don’t want some of your states to have useless methods that will never be called.

- **Concrete States** provide their own implementations for the state-specific methods. To avoid duplication of similar code across multiple states, you may provide intermediate abstract classes that encapsulate some common behavior.

State objects may store a backreference to the context object. Through this reference, the state can fetch any required info from the context object, as well as initiate state transitions.

- Both context and concrete states can set the next state of the context and perform the actual state transition by replacing the state object linked to the context.

#### Application

- Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently.
- Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the class’s fields.
- Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine.

#### Code

```typescript

// The AudioPlayer class acts as a context. It also maintains a
// reference to an instance of one of the state classes that
// represents the current state of the audio player.
class AudioPlayer is
    field state: State
    field UI, volume, playlist, currentSong

    constructor AudioPlayer() is
        this.state = new ReadyState(this)

        // Context delegates handling user input to a state
        // object. Naturally, the outcome depends on what state
        // is currently active, since each state can handle the
        // input differently.
        UI = new UserInterface()
        UI.lockButton.onClick(this.clickLock)
        UI.playButton.onClick(this.clickPlay)
        UI.nextButton.onClick(this.clickNext)
        UI.prevButton.onClick(this.clickPrevious)

    // Other objects must be able to switch the audio player's
    // active state.
    method changeState(state: State) is
        this.state = state

    // UI methods delegate execution to the active state.
    method clickLock() is
        state.clickLock()
    method clickPlay() is
        state.clickPlay()
    method clickNext() is
        state.clickNext()
    method clickPrevious() is
        state.clickPrevious()

    // A state may call some service methods on the context.
    method startPlayback() is
        // ...
    method stopPlayback() is
        // ...
    method nextSong() is
        // ...
    method previousSong() is
        // ...
    method fastForward(time) is
        // ...
    method rewind(time) is
        // ...

// The base state class declares methods that all concrete
// states should implement and also provides a backreference to
// the context object associated with the state. States can use
// the backreference to transition the context to another state.
abstract class State is
    protected field player: AudioPlayer

    // Context passes itself through the state constructor. This
    // may help a state fetch some useful context data if it's
    // needed.
    constructor State(player) is
        this.player = player

    abstract method clickLock()
    abstract method clickPlay()
    abstract method clickNext()
    abstract method clickPrevious()


// Concrete states implement various behaviors associated with a
// state of the context.
class LockedState extends State is

    // When you unlock a locked player, it may assume one of two
    // states.
    method clickLock() is
        if (player.playing)
            player.changeState(new PlayingState(player))
        else
            player.changeState(new ReadyState(player))

    method clickPlay() is
        // Locked, so do nothing.

    method clickNext() is
        // Locked, so do nothing.

    method clickPrevious() is
        // Locked, so do nothing.

// They can also trigger state transitions in the context.
class ReadyState extends State is
    method clickLock() is
        player.changeState(new LockedState(player))

    method clickPlay() is
        player.startPlayback()
        player.changeState(new PlayingState(player))

    method clickNext() is
        player.nextSong()

    method clickPrevious() is
        player.previousSong()


class PlayingState extends State is
    method clickLock() is
        player.changeState(new LockedState(player))

    method clickPlay() is
        player.stopPlayback()
        player.changeState(new ReadyState(player))

    method clickNext() is
        if (event.doubleclick)
            player.nextSong()
        else
            player.fastForward(5)

    method clickPrevious() is
        if (event.doubleclick)
            player.previous()
        else
            player.rewind(5)
```
