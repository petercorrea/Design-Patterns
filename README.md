# Software Design Techniques

A collection of common techniques often refereed to as "patterns" that aim to generalize, standardize, and optimize software maintenance, reusability and performance of web applications.

### Object Oriented Patterns

Design patterns enable us to refactor code to provide clarity and intent through structure. They allow us to apply general solutions to common problems. Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Structural patterns are concerned with how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. We will explore design patterns referenced by the "Gang of Four": Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson.

### Rendering Techniques

Browser rendering is a performance intensive job. Over time several techniques and innovations have presented alternative methods to get it done. We will cover several rendering techniques such as client and server side rendering, hydration, server components, and island architecture.

### Systems Design

Systems Design is the process of defining a digital system or product that satisfies requirements as they pertain to data design, modular software, and processing user requests.

### Performance Optimization

There are many other considerations to take when looking to optimize the performance of an app besides ond what's stated above such as steps to reduce code, speed up network requests, improve user experience.
